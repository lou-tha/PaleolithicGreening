## "Where the grass is greener - on the timing of vegetation periods and its explanatory example for large scale spatial patterns of Paleolithic hunter gatherers in Eastern Europe" (Supplement)

### Abstract

In spring, migratory animals follow the greening of the landscape, a behavior known as “surfing the green wave”. Differences in the onset of the vegetation period thus are an important parameter influencing the movements of several species. Many of these species, in turn, were relevant prey to Paleolithic hunters. Gradients in the pattern of greening therefore not only had effects on the movement of migratory animals, but probably also on the movements of hunters in their wake, and thus on the land-use of Paleolithic people in general. On a large scale, these patterns and their change through time over stadial and interstadial cycles hence might have explanatory power for the distribution of sites and taxonomic units, coinciding with otherwise invisible potential ecological boundaries or phenological patterns. Notwithstanding its vast extent of about 4 million km², the topography of the East European Plain is rather uniform and free from natural barriers. However, despite its homogeneous landscape and the absence of geographical obstacles impeding movements of humans and animals, the archaeological record seems to be surprisingly heterogeneous. The question thus arises whether other environmental factors might help explain the conspicuous mismatch between geographic homogeneity and archaeological heterogeneity. To address this issue, we estimate the onset, duration, and intensity of the vegetation period from Greenland Interstadial 9 to Greenland Stadial 3 (ca. 41 to 25 ka) in the East European Plain and infer resulting trajectories along the gradients of the greening of the landscape. Then we compare our results to the large-scale settlement structure of that period and discuss potential implications.

### **Supplement**

> Our study relies on the following work routine. This supplement is written in R. One of our primary goals is to perform all functions provided. The documentation and the complete workflow are published. All consecutive analyses can follow the exemplary procedure.  This script contains the main functionality of our research, in which all parameters needed for conducting the functions used in scripts, libraries and packages are introduced. Our project is reproducible, which is easily done by running the following script (main.R).

### Workflow

To start, open the main.R script, select all and run the script. From this main.R script all other scripts are invoked and run. To see the progress of the funcions and script, check the folder VegPer_Results (see section folder structure) and view the created csv files. Depending on the computer this code runs on and the number of data that is used, the results can appear after a while.

### Code

The scripts that can be downloaded were used to automatically calculate the vegetation periods and pull factors over multiple stadials and interstadials for BlackSea and NGRIP data sets.
